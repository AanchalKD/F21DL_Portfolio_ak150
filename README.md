# F21DL_Portfolio_ak150

This is the jupyter notebook containing my entire portfolio for the Data Mining and Machine Learning course.

The notebook contains:
- Clustering of the IRIS dataset
- Supervised Learning using the IRIS dataset, including analysis of generalisation and overfitting
- An implementation of an Artificial Neural Network and an attempt at a Convolutional Neural Network using the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset
- A comparision between the Kuzushiji-MNIST and MNIST dataset
